# random_walk_primitive
A pretty basic single-input function that plots a 1 or 2D random walk.
Takes 3 inputs : the first specifies the dimension of the random walk, the second specifiies the number of discrete steps taken in the random walk, and the third specifies the range in which the 1D random walk ranges.
