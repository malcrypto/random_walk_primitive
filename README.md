# random_walk_primitive
A pretty basic single-input function that plots a 1 or 2D random walk.
Takes 3 inputs : the first specifies the dimension of the random walk, the second specifiies the number of discrete steps taken in the random walk, and the third specifies the range in which the 1D random walk ranges.


Will be updating for greater dimensional ranges (this part isn't difficult, but the visualisation portion is, it essentially just results in a N-dimensional vectors that I could just print but that isn't as interesting). Also will update to allow free ranging for the 1D random walk.
